		<p> What is the best artistic or talent based industry/skill to design a website where artistic paticipants or the talent can profit on binary competitions? </p>

		<p> I want every single form of expression, art, ideas, and talent to be covered under one hood. However, for a MMP/MVP or Minimum Marketable Product I want the category with the largest potential ROI and adoption rate 1st. </p>

		<p>Ideally we can test multiple standardized game formats. Think American Idol live 24/7 across thousands of categories eventually. </p>
		
		<p>Think about 1 category to TEST for each file format. picture, document, video/MP4, Audio/MP3, and more....</p>

		<h2>Initial Category Ideas</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Rap MP3</li>
				<li>Dance MP4</li>
				<li>Gutiar or Vocal Soloist MP4 or MP3</li>
				<li>Painting with set materials, sizes, and parameters .jpg </li>
				<li>Solution Writing for .docx e.g. 10 pages or less on less praetorian government policy regarding healthcare prices</li>
			</ul>

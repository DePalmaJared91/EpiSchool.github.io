		What we type in on notepad is just characters these are just characters. 

		Paul says we want plain text document for computer code.

		I wonder why this is ?  
	
		.html file extension is what an html file is
	
		The best way to understand HTML is to think about math groupings.
		((2+3) * 5) = 25  for example. The parentheses matter.
		< a "<" is a opening tag and a "/>" is a closing tag. 
		<h1> This is my new HTML header with opening and closing tags. The h1 tag really makes the text bolder </h1>
		"h1" & "h1" tags are truly important. They look like the following . . . 
		but you will only see them in the notepad file not in the browser as they are written verbatim with nothing within them. 

		<p> "p" tags or paragraph tags are also a useful way to divide information. This is the 1st paragraph of text.</p>

		<p> "p" tags give the text a line break so that there is space between lines of text. This is the 2nd paragraph of text.</p>

		<p> Otherwise the text at least from notepad will all appear inline. <a href="EpiLesson1.html">Let's Explore A Social BetWork or "Social Met Work" </a> 3rd paragraph</p>

		<h2>This is a 2nd Level Header</h2>

		<p> "p" tags or paragraph tags are also a useful way to divide information. This is the 4th paragraph of text.</p>

		<p> "p" tags give the text a line break so that there is space between lines of text. This is the 5th paragraph of text.</p>
